description: A SPLOM comparing attributes of cars in the scatterplots, with a color encoding indicating whether the cars are all-, rear-, or front-wheel drive. This chart helps show, for example, that rear- and front-wheel-drive cars can be separated by their curb weight in conjunction with city-mpg or highway-mpg more than by their width and length.
