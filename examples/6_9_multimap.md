description: Even with different measures, these three choropleths illustrate the value of aligning scales and maintaining coordinate systems. The maps show the population of each state, the percentage of the population that are engineers, and the number of hurricanes. (The very different map color schemes suggest that engineers do not cause hurricanes.)
